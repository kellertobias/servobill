/**
 * Decorator to explicitly mark a public endpoint that doesn't require authorization.
 *
 * This decorator does nothing functionally but serves as an explicit marker
 * that the developer has consciously decided this endpoint should be public.
 * It satisfies the ESLint rule that requires either @Authorized() or @AllowUnauthorized()
 * on public methods in resolver files.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   @AllowUnauthorized()
 *   @Query(() => PublicData)
 *   async getPublicData(): Promise<PublicData> {
 *     // This endpoint is intentionally public
 *   }
 *
 * @returns A no-op decorator that satisfies the ESLint rule
